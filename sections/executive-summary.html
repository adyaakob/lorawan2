        <div class="summary-overview">
            <p class="lead">
                This technical proposal outlines a LoRaWAN-based real-time worker tracking system designed specifically for remote oil palm plantations in Sabah, Malaysia. The system aims to monitor 3,000 workers across 300 hectares of plantation area using long-range, low-power wireless technology.
